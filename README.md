# H1 Project: TiC Tac ToE - Multiplayer
---

To be exact, its DoublePlayer

App link: https://vidyullathakandipati.github.io/tic-tac-toe/

## H2 Project overview:
***
I built this to accomplish my project 0 at GA.
I was expected to build any working version of Tic-tac-toe. I chose multiplayer to gain knowledge on the how a web app should be synchronised between multi windows.

## H2 Features:
___
This is a basic 3X3 Tic tac toe game designed to have two and only two players.
Players / Users are being signed-in using the emailId and password.
These accounts should be already created on the firebase(in the project Authentication).
Player1 will be asked to choose his key from (X / O), and who ever choses will be the player1.
Player2(Or who ever has not chosen) will get the other key
and players can only play when its their turn.
The moves, scores and choice of the keys are displayed for all the users at the same time.

## H2 Built With:
---
* HTML
* css
* JavaScript
* jQuery v1.12.4
* firebase 3.6.4

## H2 Usage:
---
* Each user opens the link specified above.
* Game board would be same across.
* Any user can select the key first and he becomes the player1.
* He can start the game.
* And then the turn goes to player2 and this continues until there is a win condition or draw.
* Scores are updated across the players.
* Any one player can press 'New Game' to start a new game and this applies across.
* Any one player can press 'Reset scores' to reset all the scores and start a new game, this also applies across.

## H2 Installation:
---

## H2 Future releases:
---
Yes, I plan on refactoring and fixing all the known issues and add more functionality if I can.
So watch the space for more :)

## H2 Known Issues:
---
The system goes weird if both the players press 'New game' or 'Reset Scores' at a time.
